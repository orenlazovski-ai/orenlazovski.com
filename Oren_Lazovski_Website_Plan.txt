**Platform Recommendation: Wix**

- **Why Wix is a Good Fit:**
  - User-friendly drag-and-drop editor.
  - Visual-focused templates perfect for artists.
  - Built-in tools for video, photo galleries, and event calendars.
  - Multilingual options (English, German, Hebrew).
  - Affordable pricing plans.

- **Considerations:**
  - Limited scalability for advanced features (WordPress may be better for that).
  - Design lock-in once a template is chosen.

- **Alternatives:**
  - Squarespace: Sleek and professional designs.
  - WordPress: Highly customizable for long-term flexibility.
  - Webflow: Professional-grade design with advanced control.
